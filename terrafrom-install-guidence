frist of all we need to create one ec2-instance simple with default security group.
make sure your instance is in running state.
now we need to create one i am role from creadientils,
go into action bar --> security --> modify iam ---> create new i am role with administrative access.
then finally attach this rule to your ec2-instance.
take a ssh of your ec2-instance
run command  --->  sudo apt update <----
then you need to clone your remote repository into your server
---->  git clone <your remote repository url>  <------
take this repostory access into vs-code 
ctrl+shift+p   ---> git clone from git hub --> select your repo.
then ctrl+shift+p ----> auto git init
