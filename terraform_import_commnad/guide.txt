# what basically terraform import is ?
--> terraform import command will help to import and create existing resources in terraform 
infrastructure.



# in this file i have explained all the steps to how to import existing manually created resource in 
terraform infrastructure.


example 1) suppose i have instance which i have created manually we need instance name and instance id
instance name: (Terraform_test)
instance_id: (i-02df43740dcc77fb9)

create simple .tf file 
example ec2.tf   # inside file add below content
resources "aws_instance" "Terraform_test" {
    # leave it empty
}

# now we need to run terraform import command 
# syntax of command  = terraform import aws_instance.<instance_name> <instance_id>
terraform import aws_instance.Terraform_test i-02df43740dcc77fb9

then run command: terraform show this will show infrastructure copy it into your ec2.tf file.
and then apply this will create terraform tfstatefile.
